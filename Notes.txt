
WEb Forms Architecture:
1) Event - driven programming
2) control-- events,properties and methods which is enclosed in the class of the control.

using System.Web;  --- Web namespaces
using System.Web.UI; ----> UI part---- page

UI consists of 2 parts
1) Design---> .aspx
		2 parts----- Design view (drag and drop)
			     Source View(html)

2) Code----> .aspx.cs ( Code behind)

At Runtime:

1) Single class is formed out of 2 partial classes and then a object is created.
2) Page tree is created...



above 2 files(Design/source code & code behind) work in conjunction with each other
and so both are having a class metnioned as "Partial" with them. 

When the page loads it when the page load event occurs, then  I want to set
the textbox text property to "Hello Admin"

TextBox1.Text="Hello Admin"


event--- happenning----
button obejct ->click event
Delegate----->  calls--->method(button click method must fire)




Life cycle: Events fire in a sequence on their own, and so we have a attribute in the
 page/form --> auto event wireup=true
Page
1) PreInit----> Prior to Initialization
2) Init-----> Initialization started
3) InitComplete----> Initialization completd
4) Load---load started
5) LoadComplete--- load completed
6) Other events realted to the controls on the page follow like click,mouse move, etc



If the page is going to the server and coming back again to the clinet(browser) the 
event whihc causes the page to go to the server is called as "postback" which happens 
when u click a "run at=server" attribute object.
When the postback occurs the page RE-LOADS.
A Postback is available for every control on the page/form.
Button has "Postback" enabled by default.

But for some controls it is not enabled by default like the button.
